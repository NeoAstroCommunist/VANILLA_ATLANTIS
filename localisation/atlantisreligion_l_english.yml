 hellenic_titan_religion_desc:0 "In the eyes of Titanolatreians, Gaia's "mother of monsters" title is taken to a new level by stating that the Olympian gods were actually just 'perfect monsters' and nothing else more divine than that, and that the only true divinities were the overthrown titans, who were also the first to create mankind in Atlantis and Phaecia, believing that Atlantis was originally created by Atlas to act as both helpers for him in understanding the cosmos better, but also as a sort of experiment, with more intelligence than a titan but none of the divine strength. Thus, they pray for the little bit of strength the titans have left to give them and, otherwise, do what they've always done: survived against even the impossible, when it was demanded of them by the monstrous Olympians."
