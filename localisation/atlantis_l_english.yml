 AT1_soldiers: "Reform the Army"
 AT1_soldiers_title: "Outdated Army"
 AT1_soldiers_desc: "Just a century ago, the Phoenician army was the most advanced in the known world, but during the civil war, Onias bet on a rabble of militia hordes, which allowed him to win the war, but entailed the complete collapse of the entire structure that existed before, which needs to be restored."
 AT1_save_smart: "No Heir"
 AT1_save_smart_title: "Looming Crisis"
 AT1_save_smart_desc: "Onias' grandfather, also Onias, was a recognized laughing stock, but, unfortunately, extremely tenacious. Onias got nothing from his grandfather but good health. The brilliant ruler successfully united the fragmented country, but was so busy that he did not have time to make an heir at all. Now he is over 60 and the issue of inheritance has become extremely acute. Either Onias will find an heir somewhere, or the dynasty will be interrupted."
 AT1_highlands: "Highlanders"
 AT1_highlands_title: "Question of Hills"
 AT1_highlands_desc: "Earlier, many centuries ago, there was lawlessness in New Phoenicia. The peasants not only had no rights, they were held for cattle, which forced tens of thousands to flee to the barren hills in search of a better life. For a long time they resisted conquest thanks to their powerful confederation, but internal contradictions have recently broken it up, which gives us an excellent opportunity to put an end to the freedom of the hills."
 AT1_theodosians: "Theodosia"
 AT1_theodosians_title: "Roman Barbarians"

The state quickly merged into Islamic culture and now it is difficult to find traces of a once Christian civilization in it. It's time to return the ancient city to the side of Christ."
 AT1_crusade_finiqia: "Crossing the Bothrota"
 AT1_crusade_finiqia_title: "Crusade"
 AT1_crusade_finiqia_desc: "Bothrota, the river that separated the Islamic lands from the Christian, is now the border between us and the enemy. We have to cross the river and take up a position in Kasywbya to prepare for an attack on the Sultanate's capital."

 AT1_reconquer_qartba_title: "End the Sultanate"

 AT1_ships_title: "Navy is Important"

 AT1_muslim_islands_title: "Pearls and Death"
 AT1_muslim_islands_desc: "During the Muslim invasion of our land, they seized our island as a springboard for invasion. The invasion was repulsed, but the island remained for the invaders. We must return him, and at the same time take away from the enemy his possessions in the southern archipelago."
 AT1_BIG_port: "Opening to the World"
 AT1_BIG_port_title: "Opening to the World"
 AT1_BIG_port_desc: "Isolation from the outside world has turned us from an advanced people into a bunch of backward barbarians. In order not to lag behind the Europeans too much, we should open up to the world, and for this it is worth expanding commerce in the largest city on the continent."

Caprera, the port city that connected Salonae with the mainland, is officially only in the temporary occupation of Theodosia, which they, however, are not eager to end. The upper circles suggested that we first get the support of the Pope, expecting that he would help us put pressure on our rivals."
 A11_build_harbour: "Shipbuilding Industry"
 A11_build_harbour_title: "Shipbuilding Industry"

 A11_church: "Bread and Churches"
 A11_church_title: "Bread and Churches"

 A11_find_allies_title: "Searching for Friends"
 A11_find_allies_desc: "One of the important points in the demonstration of our strength is the presence of allies, any allies. The main thing is that the enemy sees that we are not alone."

 A11_pressure_oceania_title: "Pressure Oceania"
 A11_pressure_oceania_desc: "Oceania, patchwork confederation of island republics. Not of particular value from an economic point of view, but extremely useful from a military point of view, as a lever of pressure on neighboring Magnusia."

 A11_reintegrate_caprera_title: "Reintegrate Caprera"
 A11_reintegrate_caprera_desc: "The return of Caprera to its homeland is only the beginning of the reconquest of our lands. Until we are ready to move on, we'll have to fortify Caprera and rebuild the city."

 A11_develop_salonae_title: "City That Never Sleeps"
 A11_develop_salonae_desc: "Salonae is a fast growing city with something constantly happening. Soldiers train, ships come and go, bureaucrats filling out paperwork... oops, the paper is out again.

 A11_arpinium_dye_title: "Roman Purple"
 A11_arpinium_dye_desc: "A unique color created in the Roman colony of Aurichia. It is made from a rare mollusk that lives only on the banks of the Arpinum.

If we increase the production of Roman purple, we can make good money."
 A11_loans: "Loans"
 A11_loans_title: "Loans"
 A11_loans_desc: "Loans are profitable and very convenient. A citizen is more willing to take the risk of opening his own business if he has the money for it.

In connection with our unexpected enrichment, the senators decided not to forget the tradition and outlined another reform under the good intention of bringing the army into proper shape in order to protect the homeland, but behind the scenes they are already counting the profit from weapons which will exist only on paper and bonuses for work that will not be done."

 A11_thermopylae_desc: "Thermopylae was given to the Legion long ago as payment for the defense of our lands from the western barbarians.

 A11_magnusia: "Magnusia"
 A11_magnusia_title: "Magnusia"

 A11_atlantis_title: "Aurichia"
 A11_atlantis_desc: "We have been able to recover all the lands that belonged to the Roman province of Aurichia and we can proclaim the long-awaited end to a civil war that has lasted for centuries.

 A12_culture_punics_title: "Homdeum and Batria"
 A12_culture_punics_desc: "The Punic peoples live in Homdeum and Batria, causing concern among the aristocracy, which believes that foreigners can go over to the enemy in case of conflict and open a passage directly to the capital.

 A10_generic_fleet_desc: "Magnusia has a surprisingly strong fleet. Heavy ships, light ones and several small boats for transporting soldiers. But our fleet is good in case of a war against one or two states, but the combined fleet of several states can batter our armada.

 A10_salonae_deving_branch_desc: "After moving our administration to the island, we suddenly found out that all this time Salonae was not only a port city, but also a major producer of excellent paper.

It is quite expected that a messenger came from Theodosia with a proposal to finally unite our families into one. It's hard to accept such an offer, but it's also hard to refuse. If we agree, we will lose our independence again, if we refuse, we will lose a reliable ally and make a dangerous enemy."

 atlantis_A10.5.d: "During your daily walk, an adviser approached you and began to tell you about the amazing teaching that existed during the heyday of the Roman Empire - the belief in the Unconquered Sun. The story sounds very interesting, especially the part about the cult of the ruler, but then you suddenly realize that faith in the sun is a pagan cult! And he constantly mentions that this is our old faith, talks about all its advantages for the monarch and about the cultural flourishing that a more detailed study of it could bring. It all sounds somehow too suspicious, yet extremely interesting..."

 atlantis_A10.6.d: "Salonae was the ancient capital of the province of Aurichia and from the point of view of legitimizing our rule, it would be logical to make it our new capital. However, no one will forbid us to stay in Diocletianopolis and make a second Constantinople out of it."

 atlantis_ATL.6.t: "Dwarfs"
 atlantis_ATL.6.d: "Urgent news from Pandonius! During the excavations, the miners accidentally got into an already dug tunnel. Exploring it, they found strange people - lower than usual, but very strong. When our people tried to establish contact with the unknown creatures, they were attacked by other creatures, also short, but skinny and green. The battle began and our miners, not coming up with anything better, broke the piles holding the ceiling, which led to the collapse of the entire mine. However, strange people were able to save them and take them out of the mine. We may not understand each other, but something tells us that these strange people are not our enemies."
 atlantis_ATL.6.a: "What is going on?!"
 atlantis_ATL.7.t: "Going Home"
 atlantis_ATL.7.d: "Some time has passed since we met dwarfs. During this time, we were able to learn each other's languages and learned a lot about their home. However, even though the meeting with the dwarves itself was amazing, their stories were mostly about how they mined ore and got drunk in various places. We offered dwarfs to stay, but they refused, because they cannot leave their land and their people in the most difficult time. After exchanging goodbyes, the column of dwarves together with the king goes into the darkness."
 atlantis_ATL.7.a: "I hope that we will meet again"
