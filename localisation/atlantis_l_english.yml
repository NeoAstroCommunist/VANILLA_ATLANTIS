 #Missions
 AT1_soldiers: "Reform the Army"
 AT1_soldiers_title: "Outdated Army"
 AT1_soldiers_desc: "Just a century ago, the Phoenician army was the most advanced in the known world, but during the civil war, Onias bet on a rabble of militia hordes, which allowed him to win the war, but entailed the complete collapse of the entire structure that existed before, which needs to be restored."
 AT1_save_smart: "No Heir"
 AT1_save_smart_title: "Looming Crisis"
 AT1_save_smart_desc: "Onias' grandfather, also Onias, was a recognized laughing stock, but, unfortunately, extremely tenacious. Onias got nothing from his grandfather but good health. The brilliant ruler successfully united the fragmented country, but was so busy that he did not have time to make an heir at all. Now he is over 60 and the issue of inheritance has become extremely acute. Either Onias will find an heir somewhere, or the dynasty will be interrupted."
 AT1_highlands: "Highlanders"
 AT1_highlands_title: "Question of Hills"
 AT1_highlands_desc: "Earlier, many centuries ago, there was lawlessness in New Phoenicia. The peasants not only had no rights, they were held for cattle, which forced tens of thousands to flee to the barren hills in search of a better life. For a long time they resisted conquest thanks to their powerful confederation, but internal contradictions have recently broken it up, which gives us an excellent opportunity to put an end to the freedom of the hills."
 AT1_theodosians: "Theodosia"
 AT1_theodosians_title: "Roman Barbarians"
 AT1_theodosians_desc: "Theodosia is one of several post-Roman states on the continent. The lands it occupies once belonged to our people and now that we have gained strength, we will be able to return the lands of our ancestors."
 AT1_become_strong: "Traitor King"
 AT1_become_strong_title: "Tale of Barqaqart"
 AT1_become_strong_desc: "Once a Christian state, Barqaqart broke away from the Phoenician empire during the civil war. Later, during the succession crisis, the king's son, raised in Qartba Jdida, staged a coup with support from abroad and soon announced that he had converted to Islam. The state quickly merged into Islamic culture and now it is difficult to find traces of a once Christian civilization in it. It's time to return the ancient city to the side of Christ."
 AT1_crusade_finiqia: "Crossing the Bothrota"
 AT1_crusade_finiqia_title: "Crusade"
 AT1_crusade_finiqia_desc: "Bothrota, the river that separated the Islamic lands from the Christian, is now the border between us and the enemy. We have to cross the river and take up a position in Kasywbya to prepare for an attack on the Sultanate's capital."
 AT1_reconquer_qartba: "Siege of Qartba Jdiba"
 AT1_reconquer_qartba_title: "End the Sultanate"
 AT1_reconquer_qartba_desc: "The enemy's capital will be in our hands. The first city founded by our ancestors on the continent has been occupied by conquerors for many centuries. We will return our city to the empire and finally expel the foreign invaders from our land!"
 AT1_victory: "Hegemony"
 AT1_victory_title: "An Undeniable Victory"
 AT1_victory_desc: "Our state has seen many ups and downs, but today we finally won. No matter what happens, maybe our state will disappear from the face of the earth, but our legacy will remain forever. We have won the future for our people."
 AT1_ships: "Navy is Important"
 AT1_ships_title: "Navy is Important"
 AT1_ships_desc: "A huge continent in the middle of a merciless ocean. It is logical that the peoples living on it will strive for water. If we do not want to be bypassed from the sea again, we must restore the fleet and restore it to its former greatness."
 AT1_muslim_islands: "Southern Archipelago"
 AT1_muslim_islands_title: "Pearls and Death"
 AT1_muslim_islands_desc: "During the Muslim invasion of our land, they seized our island as a springboard for invasion. The invasion was repulsed, but the island remained for the invaders. We must return him, and at the same time take away from the enemy his possessions in the southern archipelago."
 AT1_BIG_port: "Opening to the World"
 AT1_BIG_port_title: "Opening to the World"
 AT1_BIG_port_desc: "Isolation from the outside world has turned us from an advanced people into a bunch of backward barbarians. In order not to lag behind the Europeans too much, we should open up to the world, and for this it is worth expanding commerce in the largest city on the continent."
